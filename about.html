                        <h3>OUR HOME-GROWN BEGINNINGS</h3>
                        <p>
                            Elena's Savor was quite literally a kitchen start-up. The first batch of pizzas and 
                            cakes were baked and perfected right in the small home kitchen of owner Veronica O. Alcaide, 
                            using time-tested recipes inherited from her grandmother, Elena. It was here, amidst the
                            aroma of fresh dough and sweet custards, that the brand's core philosophy was established: 
                            that the best food is made with a personal touch and the warmth of home.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The business wasn't born from a plan, but from passion. Veronica simply shared her homemade 
                            favorites with neighbors and friends, and word-of-mouth about the exceptional quality 
                            and taste quickly spread. The local demand grew so fast that the kitchen counter 
                            could no longer handle the orders, prompting the move from a home operation to 
                            a dedicated local store, bringing that cherished "homemade" feeling to the entire community.
